For damages or loss which is not covered by sentence 1, and which is due to intentional or grossly negligent breaches of the contract as well as bad faith on the part of AMBOSS, its legal representatives or its agents, AMBOSS is liable pursuant to the statutory provisions. In such cases however, the compensation liability is limited to the foreseeable, typically-occurring damages and loss, insofar as AMBOSS, its legal representatives or agents have not acted intentionally.

A further liability of AMBOSS is hereby excluded, regardless of the claim’s legal nature; this shall apply in particular for tortious claims or claims for compensation to futile expenses instead of the performance.
