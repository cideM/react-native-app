                            <p>

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>1.2. </strong>With regards to the terminology used in this privacy policy, i.e. ‘personal data’, ‘data subject’ or ‘processing we refer to Art.4 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation, hereinafter referred to as GDPR).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>1.3. </strong>We are processing personal data of our users exclusively in accordance with the relevant provisions of data protection regulations. In accordance to art. 13 GDPR we inform you about the legal basis of our data processing. Unless the legal basis is not specified in this privacy policy the following applies: legal basis for the processing of personal data with separate consent are art. 6 par. 1 lit. a and art. 7 GDPR. Legal basis for the processing of personal data until the satisfaction of all services and legal obligations is art. 6 lit. c GDPR and legal basis for the processing of personal data in order to safeguard our legal interests is art. 6 par. 1 lit. f GDPR.
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h3>2. Transfer to a Third Party and Third-Party Providers</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>2.1.</strong> In agreement with the applicable legal regulations we are authorised to assign other companies or legal persons to carry out tasks on our behalf, for which the transfer of personal data is required. These include, for example, companies specializing in i.e. payment processing, the transfer of goods or the delivery of newsletters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>2.2. </strong>Personal data shall only be transferred to third parties on the basis of legal allowances and within the framework of legal provisions. We are only transferring personal data to third parties if this is necessary on the basis of art. 6 par. 1 lit. b GDPR for the fulfillment of the contract or when we pursue our legitimate interests in accordance to art. 6 par. 1 lit. f GDPR. If third parties are assigned with the processing of data within the scope of a so-called ‘commissioned-processing contract’ this is done on the basis of art. 28 GDPR.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>2.3.</strong> Provided we are using services of third parties in order to perform a service, we are taking appropriate legal measures as well as technical and organisational measures in order to ensure the protection of personal data according to the relevant legal provisions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>2.4.</strong> These measures may include the transfer of personal data to servers outside of the EU or trustworthy third parties based outside the EU for fulfilment of contract. You should be aware that some countries might not offer the same lawful protection of personal data as EU member states. While your personal data is stored in another country, courts, law enforcement authorities and national authorities of the respective country may access this data in conformity with the national laws. Subject to legal regulations we promise that every third party processing your personal data outside of the EU must take measures to ensure maximum security of your data according to our instructions as well as EU legislation. Therefore we only have data processed in a third country if the requirements according to art. 44 ff. GDPR are fulfilled.
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h2>What information we collect</h2>
                            <h3>3. Fulfillment of Contractual Agreements / User-Account</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3.1. </strong>We are processing basic data (i.e. name, address and further contact data), contractual data (i.e. payment information, services received and/or used) for the fulfillment of the contractual obligations and services in accordance with art. 6 par. 1 lit. b GDPR.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3.2.</strong> In order to fully use our service a registration is required. During the creation of the corresponding user-account you will be required to provide personal information (i.e. email address) and specify a password. This information serves as the basis for the login as well as the secure identification on AMBOSS.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3.3.</strong> In addition we will possibly ask you for further personal data such as the desired specialization, university, address or gender, i.e. as part of a survey or within your user-account. If this information is not required for the fulfillment of the contract it is provided on a voluntary basis. We will use this information to tailor our services to your needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3.4.</strong> During the registration and each time the user logs in and uses the online service, we save the IP address as well as the timestamp of the respective user action. The storage is done due on the basis of our legitimate interests and the interest of the user to be protected from misuse and unauthorized usage in accordance with art. 6 par. 1 lit. f GDPR.
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                            <h3>4. Contact Form</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>4.1. </strong>In case of questions of any kind we are offering you the opportunity to contact us via a contact form on our website. In order to use the contact form a valid email address must be given enabling us to identify who has sent the request and answer it. Further information can be provided on a voluntary basis. The processing of data for the purpose of establishing contact with us is carried out in accordance with art. 6 par. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR based on your voluntarily given consent.
                            </p>
                            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                <strong>5.1.</strong> You have the possibility to apply for any current job opportunities through our online application portal. In order to process your application we collect, process and use the personal data you provided through our online application portal. Your personal data is used solely for processing your application. This includes establishing contact with you. Your personal data shall only be transferred to third parties within the bounds of a commissioned-processing contract or after the provision of your explicit unambiguous consent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>5.2. </strong>For our online application portal we are using the services of Greenhouse Software Inc., 455 Broadway, New York NY, 10013 USA, a cloud services provider located in the United States of America. Accordingly, if you are located outside of the United States, your personal data will be transferred to the United States once you submit it through this site. Because the European Union Commission has determined that United States data privacy laws do not ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data collected from EU data subjects, the transfer will be subject to an appropriate commissioned-processing contract.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>5.3.</strong> Your personal data will be retained by AMBOSS as long as AMBOSS determines it is necessary to evaluate your application for employment. In case of a rejection, your data will be completely deleted after 6 months. In case you have agreed to retaining your data further, AMBOSS will transfer your data to a talent pool and completely delete your data after 1 year. In case AMBOSS and you enter into an employment relationship, your data will be transferred from our recruiting software Greenhouse into our HR Management software BambooHR and afterwards deleted in Greenhouse.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>5.4.</strong> The processing and storage of your personal data is based on our legitimate interests in accordance to art. 6 par. 1 lit. f GDPR, namely: the processing of your application and the filling of vacant positions.

                                <strong>6.1. </strong>Providing you have given your consent in accordance to art. 6 par. 1 p. 1 lit. a GDPR we will send periodic email newsletters to the email address you have provided. Where the registration for the newsletter included a concrete description of the newsletter content this description is authoritative for your consent.

                                <strong>6.2. </strong>For the newsletter registration we use the so-called double opt-in procedure, i.e. you need to confirm the provided email address before being added to our email list and receiving newsletters. In order to confirm the newsletter registration we will send you an email with a confirmation link, which you need to click in order to confirm your newsletter registration.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>6.3. </strong>With a registration for the newsletter we store your IP address and the date of your registration. The storage of this information shall serve as the proof of your newsletter registration.

For this purpose so-called ‘Remarketing-Tags’ are placed on AMBOSS websites as well as the websites of other participants of the Google Remarketing service. Through these Remarketing-Tags a cookie is stored on the device of the user, containing information such as browser-type/-version, operating system, referrer-URL (the previously visited site), hostname of the accessing device (ip address) and the timestamp of the server request. &nbsp;The IP addresses of AMBOSS users is not combined with with other Google data.

These cookies are invalidated after 30 days and are not used for personal identification.If this cookie has not yet expired when the user visits certain pages of AMBOSS, Google and AMBOSS GmbH will be able to tell that the user clicked on a specific advertisement and proceeded to that page. Every customer of Google Adwords receives an individual cookie. Therefore cookies cannot be tracked across the websites of different Google AdWords customers. The information collected through the conversion-cookie serves to generate statistics for Google AdWords customers that are using the Google AdWords service. Google AdWords customers are able to retrieve the total number of users clicks on advertisements that have been marked for conversion tracking. However the data gathered and evaluated will remain anonymous and the identity of the user cannot be traced.
